# Highly Cohesive,<br />Loosely Coupled<br />\(& Very Awesome\)

#### A domain-driven approach to beautiful systems

class: middle

## Let's imagine tonight

We work at a hot new startup: Delorean. The Uber for time-travel!

## üíÅ‚è≥üöñüôã

---

class: middle

## OMG it's making so much money!

üî• We're releasing features right and left! üíµ

---

class: middle

## But the code is a mess!

As systems grow, they naturally want to fall into disarray...

---

## The evolution of a feature

#### Feature: As a passenger, I want to hail a Delorean

* So I can travel in time!

---

```ruby
class TripsController
  def create
    passenger = Passenger.find(params[:passenger_id])
    driver = Driver.where(
      available: true,
      longitude: params[:longitude],
      latitude: params[:latitude]
    ).first
    driver.send_to!(passenger)
  end
end
```

## Code clutter in Rails

As the monolith grows, feature code is scattered across the app.

```
app/
  controllers/trips_controller.rb
  models/trip.rb
  helpers/trip_helper.rb
  services/calculate_trip_cost.rb
```

### Beautiful systems

---

class: middle center

### Beautiful systems are *highly cohesive*

---

class: middle center

### Beautiful systems are *loosely coupled*

---

class: middle

## Highly cohesive

Elements of a module are strongly related to each other

Near each other, are easily accessible.

---

class: middle center background-image-contain

![Cohesion illustration](images/cohesion_illustration.png)

---

class: middle

## Loosely coupled

Modules minimize their dependencies so that they are easily modifiable

--

Can evolve independently of other modules in the system

???

"The more that we must know of module B in order to understand module A, the more closely connected A is to B"

## Introducing Domain-Driven Design

DDD is both a set of high-level design activities and specific software patterns

???

First came out as a book in 2003: Domain Driven Design by Eric Evans.

It can be very confusing as it's got a lot of concepts and
enterprise-speak.

---

class: middle

## Our goals tonight

üëì **Visualize our system** from a domain perspective.

--

‚úèÔ∏è Learn insights to **draw boundaries** in our code!

--

üõ† Do a little bit of **refactoring**.

???

We'll learn to see the software from the business domain perspective

Visualization is important: you can't improve what you can't see!

---

## Strategic Design

#### Through an exercise called Context Mapping

???

Everybody say "Strategic Design"

We are going to go through an exercise called Context Mapping.

---

#### Apply It! ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Step 1: Visualize Your System

Let's generate an ERD diagram!

I like to generate mine with a gem like [`railroady`](https://github.com/preston/railroady) or
[`rails-erd`](https://github.com/voormedia/rails-erd)

If you have multiple systems, do this for each system.

### Yikes.

---

## Core domain

The **Core Domain** is the thing that your business does that makes it unique.

--

Delorean Core Domain: **Transportation**

---

## Supporting domains

A **Supporting Domain** (or Subdomain) are the areas of the business
that play roles in making the **Core Domain** happen.

--

_Delorean Supporting Domains:_

* **Driver Routing** (route me from X to Y)

--
* **Notifications** (push notifications)

--
* **Financial Transactions** (charge the card)

--
* **Product Analytics** (track business metrics)

--
* **Customer Support** (keep people happy)

---

class: middle

#### Apply It! ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Step 2: Draw domains on your diagram

Overlay your domains on top of the ERD diagram

You might discover some domains you never even thought you had!

???

Take out a pen, or whiteboard marker and draw areas of your
system that correspond to certain domains.

You may even see some domains you haven't thought of before!

## Bounded Contexts

A **Bounded Context** is:

- Concretely: a software system (like a codebase)
- Linguistically: a delineation in your domain where concepts are "bounded", or contained

???

Remember, this is because we agreed that different domains may have
different concepts, and hence different Ubiqutious Languages.

---

#### Apply It! ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Step 3: Overlay your bounded contexts

Next up - with a different color pen or marker, draw lines around system
boundaries / bounded contexts.

--

You may also find other system boundaries like:

* External cloud providers
* Other teams' services or systems

background-image: url(images/erd-4-bounded-context-extended.png)

---

## Congrats! You just made a Context Map!

A **Context Map** gives us a place to see the current system as-is (the
problem space), the strategic domains, and their dependencies.

---

## Making sense of the Context Map

We may notice a few things:

--

* One bounded context contains multiple sub-(supporting) domains

---

class: middle center background-image-contain background-white

background-image: url(images/erd-4-bounded-context-extended.png)

---

## Making sense of the Context Map

We may notice a few things:

* One bounded context contains multiple sub-(supporting) domains
* Multiple bounded contexts are required to support a single domain

???

Note upstream vs downstream dependencies. These are communication bottlenecks.

## An Ideal Architecture

Each **Domain** should have its own **Bounded Context**

Key concept in DDD!

---

## Increased cohesion!

We just found the areas where code "naturally" fits together, because
they are serving the same business goal.


???

We just found the areas where code "naturally" fits together, because
they are serving the same business goal.

We will find that these entities naturally prefer each other, since
they live in the same organizational unit.

---

#### Apply It! ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Break your application into domain modules

Incremental refactoring, using Ruby Modules to lead the way!

---

class: middle background-color-code

```ruby
class Trip < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :vehicle
  belongs_to :passenger
  belongs_to :driver
end

class TripsController < ApplicationController
  # ...
end
```

---

class: middle background-color-code

```ruby
module Ridesharing
  class Trip < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :vehicle
    belongs_to :passenger
    belongs_to :driver
  end
end

module Ridesharing
  class TripsController < ApplicationController
    # ...
  end
end
```

#### Find references to newly modulized classes and change them.

---

class: middle background-color-code

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

resources :trips
```

---

class: middle background-color-code

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

namespace :ridesharing, path: '/' do
  resources :trips
end
```

---

class: middle background-color-code

```ruby
class Invoice
  belongs_to :trip
end
```

---

class: middle background-color-code

```ruby
class Invoice
  belongs_to :trip, class_name: Ridesharing::Trip
end
```

---

## Creating domain-oriented folders

```
app/domains/ridesharing/trip.rb
app/domains/ridesharing/service_tier.rb
app/domains/ridesharing/vehicle.rb
app/domains/ridesharing/trips_controller.rb
app/domains/ridesharing/trips/show.html.erb
```

## Hence: modulizing increases cohesion

#### Let's move on to coupling...

---

## ActiveRecord relationships can be abused!

Objects start knowing too much about the entire world.

"God Objects"

---

class: middle background-color-code

```ruby
class PaymentConfirmation
  belongs_to :trip, class_name: Ridesharing::Trip
  belongs_to :passenger, class_name: Ridesharing::Passenger
  belongs_to :credit_card
  has_many :menu_items
  belongs_to :coupon_code
  has_one :retriable_email_job
  # ad infinitum...
end
```

## Aggregate Roots

**Aggregate Roots** are top-level domain models that reveal an object
graph of related entities beneath them.

--

Can be considered a **Facade**

---

class: middle center background-image-contain background-white

background-image: url(images/aggregate-root-2.png)

---

## Decrease coupling by only exposing aggregate roots

Make it a rule in your system that you may only access another domain's
**Aggregate Root**.

--

Internally, it's OK to reach for whatever you need.

---

class: middle

## Make service objects that provide Aggregate Roots

Your source domain can provide a service (Adapter) that returns the
**Aggregate Root**

???

Ship these around when communicating between domains!

---

class: middle background-color-code

```ruby
module Ridesharing
  class FetchTrip
    def call(id)
      Trip
        .includes(:passenger,
                  :trip, ...)
        .find(id)
      # Alternatively, return something custom
      # OpenStruct.new(trip: Trip.find(id), ...)
    end
  end
end
```

---

class: middle background-color-code

```ruby
class PaymentConfirmation
  belongs_to :trip, class_name: Ridesharing::Trip
  belongs_to :passenger, class_name: Ridesharing::Passenger
  # ...
end
```

---

class: middle background-color-code

```ruby
class PaymentConfirmation
  def trip
    # Returns the Trip aggregate root
    Ridesharing::FetchTrip.new.find(payment_id)
  end
end

# OLD: payment_confirmation.passenger
# NEW: payment_confirmation.trip.passenger
```

---

class: middle

## Decrease coupling by publishing events for async dependencies

Domains that only need unidirectional data flow work well here!

---

class: middle

## Just send an event notifying the outside world!

Instead of needing to know about the outside world, we simply
publish an event.

---

class: middle background-color-code

```ruby
# Old way
class TripController
  def create
    # ...
    ReallySpecificGoogleAnalyticsThing
      .tag_manager_logging('trip_created',
                           ENV['GA_ID'],
                           trip)
  end
end
```

---

class: middle background-color-code

```ruby
class TripController
  def create
    # ...
    EventPublisher.publish(:trip_created, trip.id)
  end
end
```

---

## Conway's Law and DDD

Conway's Law, paraphrased: "Software systems tend to look like the
organizations that produce them"

--

DDD modeling oftentimes reveals domains that follow organizational
layouts.

Your software systems follow organizational optimizations.

--

Thus this is a very natural place to draw a seam!

???

The organization has optimized for communication within itself,
and has likely reduced its dependencies on other organizational units.

---

## Warning: Limitations apply!

Don't try to do this on every project!

--

I've been guilty of overdesigning.

--

Try it out, step by step

--

Back it out if this doesn't "fit"

???

Here's what you can do: spike it out.
See how it feels and fits. Back it out if it doesn't work for you.
